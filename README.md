# Rebirth

Rebirth is my javascript demo for the js1k Spring'13 competition.

Every year, spring is the time for renewal.
It brings life back and buds grow again as the sun rise in the sky.
Trees are generated procedurally, so if you want new ones, just refresh the page.

Here is a link to the [demo](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1344). Some more details [here](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/details/1344).

Enjoy :)

## Minification

Minification is done in two steps:
* With Closure Compiler (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home) to remove whitespaces and comments.
* With JS Crush (http://www.iteral.com/jscrush/) for a big compression!

Some parts of the code may not 100% optimized, but it's because JS Crush gives better results if we follow some patterns.
